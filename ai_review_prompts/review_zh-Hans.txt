I need your help reviewing Chinese (Simplified) translations for a student study/productivity app.

You have access to vast amounts of real-world Chinese (Simplified) usage from Reddit, GitHub, social media, and forums. Use that knowledge to evaluate if these translations sound natural to native speakers.

CONTEXT:
- Target audience: Students aged 15-35
- App type: Study/productivity mobile app
- Tone: Friendly but professional
- Need: Natural, modern Chinese (Simplified) that young people actually use

TASK: For each translation below:
1. Does it sound natural like Chinese (Simplified) speakers would say it online (Reddit, Discord, social media)?
2. Is the formality level appropriate for a modern mobile app?
3. Would students understand and use these exact terms?
4. Are there any awkward literal translations or cultural mismatches?

IMPORTANT: 
- Think about how Chinese (Simplified) speakers talk in app UIs, social media, and casual tech forums
- Consider what terminology students use in educational contexts
- Flag anything that sounds "machine translated" or too formal/old-fashioned

FORMAT: For each translation that needs improvement, provide:
```
Translation #[number]
English: "[original]"
Current Chinese (Simplified): "[current translation]"
Issue: [what sounds unnatural/wrong]
Better Chinese (Simplified): "[improved version]"
Why: [explain based on real Chinese (Simplified) usage patterns]
```

Only flag translations that genuinely sound unnatural. If it's already good, skip it.
