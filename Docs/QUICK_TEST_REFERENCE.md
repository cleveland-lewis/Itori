## Quick Test Steps

### 1️⃣ Setup (5 min)
Create semester → Add 5 courses

### 2️⃣ Add Assignments (15 min)
Add 5 assignments to each course (25 total)

### 3️⃣ Verify Planning (5 min)
Check: All 25 have auto-generated plans

### 4️⃣ Check Calendar (10 min)
Verify events titled:
- "Studying: ..."
- "Reading: ..."
- "Reviewing: ..."
- "Practice Testing: ..."

Each event should have 2-5 tasks

### 5️⃣ Test Dynamics (10 min)
- Complete tasks → verify schedule adjusts
- Skip tasks → verify rescheduling
- Move events → verify rebalancing
- Check priority recalculation

## What to Look For

### ✅ Planner Creates:
- Study sessions for every assignment
- Multiple sessions for exams (spread over days)
- Work blocks for projects
- Reading time for essays

### ✅ Calendar Shows:
- Studying events (active learning)
- Reading events (material review)
- Reviewing events (flashcards)
- Practice Testing events (mock exams)

### ✅ Each Event Has:
- Descriptive title
- 2-5 specific tasks
- Checkboxes for completion
- Course linkage

### ✅ Dynamic Behavior:
- Completed tasks → schedule optimizes
- Missed tasks → catch-up sessions added
- Moved events → related tasks reschedule
- Priority adjusts based on:
  - Due date proximity
  - Assignment type
  - Completion status
  - Credit hours
