# Core Concepts

This page explains the fundamental data structures and relationships in Roots.

## Semesters

A semester represents an academic term. Semesters contain courses and define the active enrollment period.

### Properties
- **Academic Year** – Calendar year associated with the semester
- **Term** – Fall, Spring, Summer, or other institution-specific term
- **Start and End Dates** – Define the active period for the semester
- **Status** – Active or Archived

### Behavior
- Only one semester can be active at a time
- Active semester determines which courses appear in the planner
- Archived semesters are hidden from primary views but retain all data
- Courses are associated with a single semester

## Courses

A course represents a single academic class or subject within a semester.

### Properties
- **Course Code** – Alphanumeric identifier (e.g., "CS101")
- **Title** – Full course name
- **Credits** – Credit hours for GPA calculation
- **Instructor** – Optional faculty information
- **Color** – Visual identifier for calendar and planner views
- **Grading Scale** – Letter grades, percentage, or points-based
- **Status** – Active or Archived

### Behavior
- Courses must belong to a semester
- Archiving a course hides it from active views but preserves assignments
- Deleting a course removes all associated assignments permanently
- Course color is used throughout the interface for visual consistency

## Assignments

Assignments represent work items, assessments, or study tasks associated with a course.

### Categories

**Exam** – Scheduled assessments, typically generating multiple study sessions
**Quiz** – Short assessments, generating fewer study sessions than exams
**Project** – Long-term deliverables, broken into work sessions
**Homework** – Regular coursework, scheduled as single or multiple sessions
**Reading** – Text review assignments, scheduled based on estimated duration

### Core Properties

**Due Date and Time** – Deadline for completion. Time specificity affects scheduling.
**Priority** – High, Medium, or Low. Influences scheduling order.
**Estimated Duration** – Total time expected to complete the work (in minutes or hours).
**Difficulty/Energy Level** – High, Medium, or Low. Used for energy-aware scheduling.

### Category-Specific Properties

Different assignment categories may have additional fields:
- Exams: Number of study sessions to generate, review start date
- Projects: Milestone tracking, work session count
- Reading: Page count or estimated reading time

### Assignment Lifecycle

1. **Creation** – User defines assignment with required properties
2. **Scheduling** – Planner generates sessions based on assignment type and properties
3. **In Progress** – Sessions appear in calendar; user marks progress
4. **Completion** – Assignment marked complete; sessions removed from future schedule
5. **Archiving** – Completed assignments archived with associated course

## Modules (if applicable)

Some implementations may support subdividing courses into modules or units. Modules allow hierarchical organization of assignments within a course.

**Note:** Module support varies by version. Refer to application interface to determine availability.

## Relationships

```
Semester (1) ──→ (N) Courses
Course (1) ──→ (N) Assignments
Assignment (1) ──→ (N) Sessions (generated by planner)
```

Each relationship flows in one direction. Deleting a parent entity (e.g., a course) cascades to child entities (assignments).
