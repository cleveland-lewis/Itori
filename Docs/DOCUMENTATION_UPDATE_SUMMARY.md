## Summary

All primary user-facing documentation has been updated to reflect the new "Itori" brand name. This includes:

- ✅ README files (main, copy, and Itori-specific)
- ✅ LICENSE files (BUSL and proprietary)
- ✅ SECURITY policy
- ✅ Changelog references
- ✅ Project file references
- ✅ Repository URL references

## What Remains

The following files may still contain "Itori" references but are:
- Internal development documentation
- Build logs and temporary files
- Legacy/deprecated files
- Historical documentation that should remain unchanged

These can be updated on an as-needed basis during future development.

## Notes

- The directory name at `/Desktop/Itori` has already been updated
- The Xcode project file has been renamed to `ItoriApp.xcodeproj`
- All bundle identifiers have been updated to `clewisiii.Itori`
- Core Data model has been renamed to `Itori.xcdatamodeld`

The app is now fully branded as **Itori** in all user-facing materials and critical infrastructure.
